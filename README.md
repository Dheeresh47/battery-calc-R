# Phone Battery Usage Analysis

This project analyzes phone battery usage data from a CSV file. It identifies the biggest battery-draining apps and accounts for hidden battery consumption from the phone's operating system. The unique methodology explicitly calculates and labels this unaccounted-for usage to provide a complete, 100% accurate breakdown.

The analysis provides key insights, including a battery usage breakdown, app efficiency ratings, and a visualization of the correlation between screen time and battery usage. These findings are presented with plots that are saved and uploaded to the repository.

To run the code yourself, simply download the project, ensure all necessary R packages are installed, add your own CSV file named battery_data.csv, and run the script in your R environment.
